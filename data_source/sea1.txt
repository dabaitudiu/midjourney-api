The boundless thick fog rolled outside the window, so dense that it seemed as if the entire world had disappeared on the other side of the fog. Only the dim and hazy daylight penetrated the fog and shone into the room, maintaining a semi-dark, semi-bright atmosphere in this quiet room.In the somewhat disheveled bachelor apartment, Zhou Ming sat at his desk. The clutter on the table had been pushed aside roughly, and the exhausted-looking him was writing furiously:"On the seventh day, the situation has not changed at all. Thick fog blankets everything outside the window, and the window is sealed by some unknown force... The entire room seems to have been 'cast' into some kind of abnormal space..."No way to contact the outside world, no water or electricity, but the light is on, and the computer can still be turned on, even though I've unplugged its power cord..."As if a faint breeze suddenly came from the direction of the window, Zhou Ming, who was burying his head in the diary, suddenly raised his head. His weary eyes brightened slightly, but the next moment, he realized it was just his own illusion. The window still only showed the lingering pale fog, and a world of silence apathetically enveloped his small abode.His gaze swept over the windowsill and saw a wrench and a hammer haphazardly discarded – evidence of his attempts to leave the room over the past few days. However, these hard and crude tools now lay quietly, as if mocking his predicament.A few seconds later, Zhou Ming's expression returned to calm. With this unusual calm, he lowered his head again and continued writing:"I am trapped, in a completely clueless predicament. Over the past few days, I even tried to dismantle the roof, walls, and floor, but with all my strength, I couldn't leave a trace on the walls. This room has become... like a box 'cast' with space, with no way out..."Except for that door."But the situation outside that door... is even stranger."Zhou Ming stopped again, carefully scrutinizing the words he had just written. He casually flipped through the diary, looking at what he had recorded over the past few days – repressed words, meaningless thoughts, frustrated scribbles, and even some dark humor jotted down during moments of forced relaxation.He didn't know why he was writing all this or who would ever read this nonsense. In fact, he wasn't the type of person who habitually kept a diary. As a high school teacher with limited free time, he didn't have much energy to spare for it. But now, whether he liked it or not, he had plenty of free time.After waking up from a nap, he found himself trapped in his room. Outside the window, an unending fog shrouded everything. The fog was so thick that nothing beyond it was visible. The world seemed to have lost its day-night cycle, and a constant, dim light filled the room. The windows were sealed, there was no water or electricity, and his phone had no signal. Making noise in the room couldn't attract any help from the outside world.Like a surreal nightmare, everything in the dream operated against the laws of nature. But Zhou Ming had exhausted all means to determine one thing: there were no illusions or dreams here, just an abnormal world, and a somewhat normal version of himself.He took a deep breath and finally focused his gaze on the one door at the far end of the room.A plain, cheap white wooden door with a calendar that he hadn't changed since last year still nailed to it. The doorknob was shiny from use, and the doormat was slightly askew.That door could be opened.If this enclosed, alien room was like a cage, the cruelest part of this cage was that it actually retained a door that could be opened at any time, enticing the prisoner inside to leave. But beyond that door was not what Zhou Ming wanted as the "outside."There were no familiar corridors, no sunny streets filled with lively crowds, and none of the familiarity he knew. There was only a strange and unsettling foreign place, and that "other side" was also a situation from which there was no escape.But Zhou Ming knew he had little time to hesitate, and the so-called "choice" didn't really exist from the beginning.His food supply was limited, and he had only a quarter of his remaining water. He had tried all means to escape and call for help in this enclosed room over the past few days. Now, the only path before him was to prepare and seek a lifeline on the other side of the door. Maybe he would even get a chance to investigate the strange and oppressive supernatural situation.Zhou Ming closed the diary and tossed the pen into the nearby pen holder. He slowly got up from the desk.It was time to leave before becoming completely passive and desperate. However, after a brief moment of thought, he didn't go directly to the one door that could lead to the "outside." Instead, he walked to his bed.He wasn't sure if he could fall asleep, but even if he forced himself to lie on the bed and clear his mind, it was better than going to the "other side" in a mentally exhausted state.Eight hours later, Zhou Ming opened his eyes.Outside the window, the chaotic fog remained, and the light of day and night remained indistinguishable. He paid no attention to the outside situation. He took some food from his dwindling reserves, ate until he was 80% full, and then went to the dressing mirror in the corner of the room.The man in the mirror still had disheveled hair and appeared quite disheveled. There was no particular charm to him, but Zhou Ming stared at himself in the mirror as if to etch this image into his mind permanently.He stared at the mirror for several minutes and then spoke softly to himself, as if addressing the person in the mirror: "Your name is Zhou Ming, at least on 'this side.' You are Zhou Ming, and you must always remember that."Afterward, he turned and left.Standing in front of the familiar room door, Zhou Ming took a deep breath and placed his hand on the doorknob. He didn't carry anything extra with him, neither food nor self-defense equipment. This was based on the experiences from previous "explorations." He couldn't bring anything other than himself through that door.In fact, he even felt uncertain about bringing this "self" through the door.Zhou Ming turned the doorknob and pushed open the door. A swirling, ashen-black fog curtain appeared before him, and in the fluctuating fog, he seemed to hear the sound of waves. Stepping through the fog, he was greeted by a slightly salty sea breeze, and the illusory sound of ocean waves became real. He felt a slight rocking beneath his feet.After a moment of dizziness, Zhou Ming opened his eyes. He found himself standing on a vast, open wooden deck under dark, cloudy skies. Towering masts rose from the deck, and the horizon was invisible beyond the endless, gently undulating sea.Zhou Ming looked down and saw a body that appeared stronger than he remembered, dressed in an expensive and unfamiliar captain's uniform. He held a finely crafted, costly-looking black flintlock pistol in his hand.Yes, even his "self" had to be questioned.(Oh my god! I'm back!)
